# Image Classifier Project

This project was completed as a part of the course requirements of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree certification.

## Project Overview and Objective

The goal of this deep learning project was to train a deep neural network on a dataset of flower images. The next step was to use this trained model to classify the species of flower for new images.
The project uses PyTorch and the torchvision package. The Jupyter Notebook walks through the implementation of the image classifier. You will also find there an example of the classifier's prediction on a test image.
Finally, the classifier was converted into a python application. This application can be run from command line using two files: "train.py" and "predict.py".


## Software and libraries used:

- NumPy
- pandas
- Sklearn / scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- seaborn

## Dataset

The dataset consist of 102 flower categories and comes from http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html
